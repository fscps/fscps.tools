## Getting help

[The wiki](https://github.com/fscpscollaborative/fscps.tools/wiki) contains more details about installation and also guides to help you with some common tasks. It also contains documentation for all the module's commands. Expand the wiki's `Pages` control at the top of the content sidebar to view and search the list of command documentation pages.

Since the project started we have adopted and extended the comment based help inside each cmdlet / function. This means that every single command contains at least one fully working example on how to run it and what to expect from the cmdlet.

**Getting help inside the PowerShell console**

Getting help is as easy as writing **Get-Help CommandName**

```PowerShell
Get-Help Get-FSCPSSettings
```

*This will display the available default help.*

Getting the entire help is as easy as writing **Get-Help CommandName -Full**

```PowerShell
Get-Help Get-FSCPSSettings -Full
```

*This will display all available help content there is for the cmdlet / function*

Getting all the available examples for a given command is as easy as writing **Get-Help CommandName -Examples**

```PowerShell
Get-Help Get-FSCPSSettings -Examples
```

*This will display all the available **examples** for the cmdlet / function.*

We know that when you are learning about new stuff and just want to share your findings with your peers, working with help inside a PowerShell session isn't that great.
